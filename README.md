# DjangoBlogApp
## A Blog App built using Django and Bootstrap

This was my first project, where I learnt a lot from Auth, models, signals, views, messages etc and many more concepts in django framework.
Special Thanks to Corey Schafer for educating and inspiring an entire generation of python devs
